Please show me a derivation of the equations for the diffusion equation for radiation transport

 

The diffusion equation for radiation transport is a simplified form of the radiative transfer equation (RTE), used when the medium is optically thick and scattering dominates over absorption. Here's a step-by-step derivation of the diffusion approximation starting from the RTE:

1. Radiative Transfer Equation (RTE)

The time-independent RTE in a scattering medium is:

$ \hat{\Omega} \cdot \nabla I(\vec{r}, \hat{\Omega}) + \kappa I(\vec{r}, \hat{\Omega}) = \kappa B(T) + \sigmas \int{4\pi} P(\hat{\Omega}, \hat{\Omega}') I(\vec{r}, \hat{\Omega}') \, d\hat{\Omega}' $

Where:

( I(\vec{r}, \hat{\Omega}) ): specific intensity at position ( \vec{r} ) in direction ( \hat{\Omega} )
( \kappa ): absorption coefficient
( \sigma_s ): scattering coefficient
( B(T) ): Planck function (blackbody radiation)
( P(\hat{\Omega}, \hat{\Omega}') ): scattering phase function
2. Assumptions for Diffusion Approximation

To simplify:

The medium is optically thick (photons undergo many scatterings).
The radiation field is nearly isotropic.
Scattering is dominant over absorption: ( \sigma_s \gg \kappa ).
Use first-order spherical harmonics expansion (P1 approximation).
3. Moment Equations

Define:

Zeroth moment (energy density): $ \phi(\vec{r}) = \int_{4\pi} I(\vec{r}, \hat{\Omega}) \, d\hat{\Omega} $
First moment (flux): $ \vec{F}(\vec{r}) = \int_{4\pi} \hat{\Omega} I(\vec{r}, \hat{\Omega}) \, d\hat{\Omega} $
Take moments of the RTE:

Zeroth moment: $ \nabla \cdot \vec{F} + \kappa \phi = \kappa 4\pi B(T) $
First moment: $ \nabla \cdot \mathbf{P} + \kappa \vec{F} = 0 $
Where ( \mathbf{P} ) is the radiation pressure tensor.

4. Fick‚Äôs Law (Diffusion Approximation)

Assume: $ \vec{F} = -D \nabla \phi $

Where ( D ) is the diffusion coefficient: $ D = \frac{1}{3(\kappa + \sigma_s(1 - g))} $

Here, ( g ) is the average cosine of the scattering angle (anisotropy factor).

5. Diffusion Equation

Substitute Fick‚Äôs law into the zeroth moment equation:

$ \nabla \cdot (-D \nabla \phi) + \kappa \phi = \kappa 4\pi B(T) $

Or:

$

\nabla \cdot (D \nabla \phi) + \kappa \phi = \kappa 4\pi B(T) $
This is the diffusion equation for radiation transport.

Would you like a diagram or visual summary of this derivation?

 

 

 

 

Nice derivation but in the time dependent radiative transport equation can we include a scattering term on the RHS in which the scattering cross section is a function of the frequency of incident radiation and a function of the angle of the incident radiation so the scattering term integrates all the terms which are scattered from a direction into the beam direction and also from one frequency into the frequency of the beam

 

 

 

Yes, absolutely ‚Äî you're describing a generalized, time-dependent radiative transfer equation (RTE) that includes frequency-dependent and angle-dependent scattering, which is essential in many realistic astrophysical and atmospheric applications.

üîÅ Generalized Time-Dependent Radiative Transfer Equation with Scattering

The full form of the time-dependent RTE with frequency and angle-dependent scattering is:

$ \frac{1}{c} \frac{\partial I(\vec{r}, \hat{\Omega}, \nu, t)}{\partial t} + \hat{\Omega} \cdot \nabla I(\vec{r}, \hat{\Omega}, \nu, t) + \kappa\nu I(\vec{r}, \hat{\Omega}, \nu, t) = j\nu + \int0^\infty \int{4\pi} \sigma_s(\nu', \hat{\Omega}' \rightarrow \nu, \hat{\Omega}) I(\vec{r}, \hat{\Omega}', \nu', t) \, d\hat{\Omega}' \, d\nu' $

üîç Explanation of Terms

( I(\vec{r}, \hat{\Omega}, \nu, t) ): Specific intensity at position ( \vec{r} ), direction ( \hat{\Omega} ), frequency ( \nu ), and time ( t )
( \kappa_\nu ): Absorption coefficient at frequency ( \nu )
( j_\nu ): Emission coefficient (e.g., thermal emission)
( \sigma_s(\nu', \hat{\Omega}' \rightarrow \nu, \hat{\Omega}) ): Differential scattering cross-section, describing scattering from incoming frequency ( \nu' ) and direction ( \hat{\Omega}' ) into outgoing frequency ( \nu ) and direction ( \hat{\Omega} )
The double integral accounts for redistribution of radiation in both frequency and direction due to scattering
üß† Why This Matters

This form is essential when:

Compton scattering or Raman scattering is significant (frequency shift during scattering)
Anisotropic scattering is present (e.g., Mie scattering in clouds)
Line transfer problems in stellar atmospheres or interstellar media
Multigroup radiation transport in nuclear engineering or astrophysics

Yes, thank you this is the correct equation but can you now use this to provide a derivation of the diffusion equation for radiative transport

 

 

 

Great! Let's now derive the diffusion approximation starting from the generalized time-dependent radiative transfer equation that includes frequency- and angle-dependent scattering.

üîÅ Step-by-Step Derivation of the Diffusion Equation

We begin with the generalized time-dependent RTE:

$ \frac{1}{c} \frac{\partial I(\vec{r}, \hat{\Omega}, \nu, t)}{\partial t} + \hat{\Omega} \cdot \nabla I(\vec{r}, \hat{\Omega}, \nu, t) + \kappa\nu I = j\nu + \int0^\infty \int{4\pi} \sigma_s(\nu', \hat{\Omega}' \rightarrow \nu, \hat{\Omega}) I(\vec{r}, \hat{\Omega}', \nu', t) \, d\hat{\Omega}' \, d\nu' $

1. Define Moments of the Radiation Field

Zeroth moment (energy density): $ \phi(\vec{r}, \nu, t) = \int_{4\pi} I(\vec{r}, \hat{\Omega}, \nu, t) \, d\hat{\Omega} $
First moment (flux): $ \vec{F}(\vec{r}, \nu, t) = \int_{4\pi} \hat{\Omega} I(\vec{r}, \hat{\Omega}, \nu, t) \, d\hat{\Omega} $
2. Take the Zeroth Angular Moment of the RTE

Integrate over all directions ( \hat{\Omega} ):

[ \frac{1}{c} \frac{\partial \phi(\vec{r}, \nu, t)}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot \vec{F}(\vec{r}, \nu, t) + \kappa\nu \phi(\vec{r}, \nu, t) = 4\pi j\nu + \int0^\infty \int{4\pi} \sigma_s(\nu', \hat{\Omega}' \rightarrow \nu) I(\vec{r}, \hat{\Omega}', \nu', t) \, d\hat{\Omega}' \, d\nu' ]

Here, we assume elastic scattering in angle but allow frequency redistribution.

3. Diffusion Approximation (Fick‚Äôs Law)

Assume the radiation field is nearly isotropic, so we approximate:

[ \vec{F}(\vec{r}, \nu, t) \approx -D_\nu \nabla \phi(\vec{r}, \nu, t) ]

Where the diffusion coefficient is:

[ D\nu = \frac{1}{3(\kappa\nu + \sigma_{s,\nu}^{\text{eff}})} ]

The effective scattering coefficient ( \sigma_{s,\nu}^{\text{eff}} ) accounts for angular redistribution and frequency coupling.

4. Substitute into the Zeroth Moment Equation

[ \frac{1}{c} \frac{\partial \phi(\vec{r}, \nu, t)}{\partial t} - \nabla \cdot \left( D\nu \nabla \phi(\vec{r}, \nu, t) \right) + \kappa\nu \phi(\vec{r}, \nu, t) = 4\pi j_\nu + \mathcal{S}(\vec{r}, \nu, t) ]

Where the scattering source term is:

[ \mathcal{S}(\vec{r}, \nu, t) = \int0^\infty \sigmas^{\text{int}}(\nu' \rightarrow \nu) \phi(\vec{r}, \nu', t) \, d\nu' ]

This term represents frequency redistribution due to scattering.

‚úÖ Final Form: Generalized Diffusion Equation

[ \boxed{ \frac{1}{c} \frac{\partial \phi(\vec{r}, \nu, t)}{\partial t} - \nabla \cdot \left( D\nu \nabla \phi(\vec{r}, \nu, t) \right) + \kappa\nu \phi(\vec{r}, \nu, t) = 4\pi j\nu + \int0^\infty \sigma_s^{\text{int}}(\nu' \rightarrow \nu) \phi(\vec{r}, \nu', t) \, d\nu' } ]

This is the frequency-dependent diffusion equation with scattering-induced frequency coupling.

Can you provide a numerical solver using this example to describe radiation in a 1D box with a source at one end and reflective boundaries the solver should be written in C++ and make use of the hypre library

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Creating a numerical solver for the frequency-dependent radiative diffusion equation in a 1D box using C++ and the HYPRE library is a great way to simulate radiation transport with scattering and reflective boundaries.

‚úÖ Problem Setup Summary

Equation (simplified 1D, steady-state, gray approximation):
$ -\frac{d}{dx} \left( D(x) \frac{d\phi(x)}{dx} \right) + \kappa(x) \phi(x) = S(x) $

Domain: 1D box ( x \in [0, L] )
Boundary conditions: Reflective at both ends (Neumann: ( \frac{d\phi}{dx} = 0 ))

Before I generate the code, could you confirm a few details?

Grid size: How many spatial points (e.g., 100)?
Box length ( L ): Default to 1.0?
Source: Should it be a delta function at ( x = 0 ), or a small Gaussian?
Scattering and absorption: Should we assume constant ( D ) and ( \kappa ), or spatially varying?
Output: Should the code write the solution to a file?
Once you confirm, I‚Äôll generate the full C++ code with HYPRE integration.

 

 

 

 

Use 100 grid points and L=1.0. Yes, make the source a gaussian, let's assume spatially varying D and kappa. Yes, the code should write the solution to a file.

 

 

 

 

 

Perfect! Here's a summary of the setup for the solver:

How would the solver change if a Planckian distribution was introduced as a source term at each cell point the model starts with an initial temperature distribution and includes the heating of using the specific heat capacity of the material at each cell point

 

 

 

 

Introducing a Planckian source term and temperature evolution into the radiative diffusion solver transforms the problem into a coupled nonlinear system involving radiation transport and thermal energy balance. Here's how the solver would change:

üîÅ Updated Physical Model

1. Radiative Diffusion Equation (frequency-integrated, gray approximation):

[ \frac{1}{c} \frac{\partial \phi(\vec{r}, t)}{\partial t} - \nabla \cdot \left( D(\vec{r}) \nabla \phi(\vec{r}, t) \right) + \kappa(\vec{r}) \phi(\vec{r}, t) = \kappa(\vec{r}) a T^4(\vec{r}, t) ]

( \phi ): radiation energy density
( T ): material temperature
( a ): radiation constant
( \kappa ): absorption coefficient
2. Material Energy Equation:

[ \rho c_v(\vec{r}) \frac{\partial T(\vec{r}, t)}{\partial t} = \kappa(\vec{r}) \left( \phi(\vec{r}, t) - a T^4(\vec{r}, t) \right) ]

( \rho ): material density
( c_v ): specific heat capacity
üßÆ Numerical Strategy

This is now a time-dependent, nonlinear, coupled PDE system. The solver must:

Initialize:
( T(\vec{r}, 0) ): initial temperature field
( \phi(\vec{r}, 0) = a T^4(\vec{r}, 0) )
Time-stepping loop:
Use implicit or semi-implicit schemes (e.g., backward Euler)
At each time step:
Solve the radiation diffusion equation for ( \phi )
Update the temperature using the material energy equation
Iterate if necessary (nonlinear coupling)
Boundary conditions:
Reflective for radiation: ( \nabla \phi \cdot \hat{n} = 0 )
Adiabatic for temperature: ( \nabla T \cdot \hat{n} = 0 )
üõ†Ô∏è Code Changes

Add a time loop and temperature field array
Update the source term to ( \kappa a T^4 )
Add a material energy update step
Possibly use Newton-Raphson or Picard iteration for nonlinear convergence

Would you like help integrating the HYPRE solver into this template, or visualizing the output fields in Python?

 

 

 

 

To integrate the HYPRE solver into the 3D frequency-dependent radiative diffusion code, we need to do the following for each frequency bin at each time step:

‚úÖ Integration Steps

1. Discretize the Diffusion Equation

For each frequency bin ( \nu_n ), solve:

[ \frac{1}{c} \frac{\partial \phin}{\partial t} - \nabla \cdot (D \nabla \phin) + \kappa \phin = \kappa B\nu(T) ]

We discretize this using finite differences and solve the resulting linear system:

[ An \phin^{t+1} = b_n ]

Where:

( A_n ): matrix from discretized diffusion operator
( b_n ): right-hand side from previous time step and Planck source
2. HYPRE Setup per Frequency Bin

For each frequency bin:

Create a structured grid
Define a stencil (7-point for 3D)
Assemble the matrix ( An ) and vector ( bn )
Solve using BoomerAMG or PCG
3. Code Integration Plan

I'll now generate the C++ code snippet that:

Sets up HYPRE for a single frequency bin
Builds the matrix and RHS
Solves for ( \phi_n )
Can be called inside the time loop for each frequency
Let‚Äôs generate this HYPRE integration code now.

Here's the updated C++ code that integrates the HYPRE solver into a 3D frequency-dependent radiative diffusion solver. This version includes:

A function to assemble and solve the diffusion equation for a single frequency bin
Use of a 7-point stencil for 3D finite difference discretization
Integration with BoomerAMG for solving the linear system
Output of the radiation field to a file
üìÑ Download the HYPRE-integrated 3D solver code

üß© How to Use This

The function solveRadiativeDiffusion(...) can be called inside your time loop for each frequency bin.
You can pass in the appropriate Planck source term for each bin using B_ŒΩ(T) at each cell.
The output phi will contain the updated radiation energy density for that frequency.
